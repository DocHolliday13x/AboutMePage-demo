    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Hello my name is Reece Renninger and welcome to my About Me page.  I served in the United States Marine Corps from 2012 to 2016 and exited as a Sergeant. I then went to California State University Long Beach and got my BA in Psychology.  I am making this career transition because coding is something I have always wanted to pursue and I decided I didn't want to wait any longer. </p>
