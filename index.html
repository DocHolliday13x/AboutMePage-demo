  <main>
  <p>Hello my name is Reece Renninger and welcome to my About Me page.  I served in the United States Marine Corps from 2012 to 2016 and exited as a Sergeant. I then went to California State University Long Beach and got my BA in Psychology. After graduating I began working as an Academic Advisor for a university.  My goal with Code Fellows is to become an efficient coder to break into the tech industry so I can have the job I have always dreamed about.  </p>
